# Finnkino Movies website

This is our final group project done for a course in which we studied the basics of JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to practice using JavaScript and XML together. 

It's a very basic website where you can pick a Finnkino movie theatre in Finland and the website will you then give you all the shows for the current date. The website gets the info from: http://www.finnkino.fi/xml/Schedule/
