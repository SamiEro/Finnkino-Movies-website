# Finnkino Movies website

This is our final group project done for a course in which we studied the basics of JavaScript. The purpose of this project was to practice using JavaScript and XML together. 

It's a very basic website where you can pick a Finnkino movie theatre in Finland and the website will then give you all the shows for the current date. You can also filter for specific movies by typing in the name of the movie in the search bar which appears after you have picked a movie theatre. The website gets the info from: http://www.finnkino.fi/xml/Schedule/
